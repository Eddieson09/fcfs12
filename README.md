exam:
create one program c++ language 
1. may function siya sa shortest job next shortest remaining, round robin
sjf srtf rr 3 funtion add one funtion recomended quantum time 
 create a program with c++ language and a function that need to be excuted, first function to use is the shortest job first, next is shortest remaining time first and lastly and round robin, it need to be modular and it need to add one more function that add the mean or median to calculates the optimal the quantum time that needs to be whole number and passes it to the round robin function, it needs to have arrival time, burst time, process id, remaining time , waiting time, turnaround time indside a structure named process 

 main function dont type the value for the burst time and arrival time
 when the code runs the recommended quantum time needs to be passed and the program 
 it needs to create a column that consists of process id AT,BT completion time,TT WT this table needs to appear each in evey table need to have a avegwt, avegtt,  
 the arrival time, burst time and etc need to be just AT,BT and etc in the table
recommended  quantum time, name of the algorithm the table average






 arrival time 1 3 8 4 6 7 2 5 

 burst time  53 43 18 16 24 73 99 27
